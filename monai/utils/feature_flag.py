class FeatureFlag:
    """
    A feature flag used to use for enabling/disabling experimental features and other optional behaviors.
    A flag called {name} can be set by environment variable `MONAI_FEATURE_ENABLED_{name}`
    (values considered as `True` are "true", "1", "yes", case-insensitive, everything else is considered as `False`) or
    by explicitly calling `enable()`/`disable()`.
    When first accessing its property `enabled` and no value has been explicitly set using `enable()`/`disable()`,
    it will set the value of the flag based on the environment variable and
    if that is not set uses the default value passed in the constructor.
    After this, the value can only be changed using `enable()`/`disable()`.

    Args:
        name: the name of the feature flag.
        default: the default value of the flag.
            Only used if the environment variable is not set and
            the flag has not been explicitly set using `enable()`/`disable()`.
            Kwarg only, default is `False`.
