    """
    ``Compose`` provides the ability to chain a series of calls together in a
    sequence. Each transform in the sequence must take a single argument and
    return a single value, so that the transforms can be called in a chain.

    ``Compose`` can be used in two ways:

    #. With a series of transforms that accept and return a single
       ndarray / tensor / tensor-like parameter.
    #. With a series of transforms that accept and return a dictionary that
       contains one or more parameters. Such transforms must have pass-through
       semantics; unused values in the dictionary must be copied to the return
       dictionary. It is required that the dictionary is copied between input
       and output of each transform.

    If some transform generates a list batch of data in the transform chain,
    every item in the list is still a dictionary, and all the following
    transforms will apply to every item of the list, for example:

    #. transformA normalizes the intensity of 'img' field in the dict data.
    #. transformB crops out a list batch of images on 'img' and 'seg' field.
       And constructs a list of dict data, other fields are copied::

            {                          [{                   {
                'img': [1, 2],              'img': [1],         'img': [2],
                'seg': [1, 2],              'seg': [1],         'seg': [2],
                'extra': 123,    -->        'extra': 123,       'extra': 123,
                'shape': 'CHWD'             'shape': 'CHWD'     'shape': 'CHWD'
            }                           },                  }]

    #. transformC then randomly rotates or flips 'img' and 'seg' fields of
       every dictionary item in the list.

    The composed transforms will be set the same global random seed if user called
    `set_determinism()`.

    When using the pass-through dictionary operation, you can make use of
    :class:`monai.transforms.adaptors.adaptor` to wrap transforms that don't conform
    to the requirements. This approach allows you to use transforms from
    otherwise incompatible libraries with minimal additional work.

    Note:

        In many cases, Compose is not the best way to create pre-processing
        pipelines. Pre-processing is often not a strictly sequential series of
        operations, and much of the complexity arises when a not-sequential
        set of functions must be called as if it were a sequence.

        Example: images and labels
        Images typically require some kind of normalization that labels do not.
        Both are then typically augmented through the use of random rotations,
        flips, and deformations.
        Compose can be used with a series of transforms that take a dictionary
        that contains 'image' and 'label' entries. This might require wrapping
        `torchvision` transforms before passing them to compose.
        Alternatively, one can create a class with a `__call__` function that
        calls your pre-processing functions taking into account that not all of
        them are called on the labels.
